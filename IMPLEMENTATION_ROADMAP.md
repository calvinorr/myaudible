# Discover Implementation Roadmap

## üéØ Next Session Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Check current status
curl http://localhost:3001/api/discover/recommendations?type=all&limit=5

# Test series detection with real data  
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/discover/recommendations?type=series&mock=false"

# View current schema
npx prisma studio
```

## üìä Current Working Features

### ‚úÖ Ready to Demo
- **Discover UI**: Navigate to `/discover` - fully functional with mock data
- **Database Schema**: All AI models created and deployed
- **Navigation**: Discover link added to main nav
- **Error Handling**: Timeout protection and graceful fallbacks
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode compatible

### ‚úÖ Technical Infrastructure
- **Dependencies**: Cheerio, RSS Parser, enhanced Prisma schema
- **APIs**: Recommendation and author release endpoints created
- **Context**: FavoriteAuthors system optimized for performance
- **Mock Data**: High-quality sample recommendations for UI testing

## üî• Priority Fixes for Next Session

### 1. CRITICAL: Fix API Timeouts (30 minutes)
**Problem**: External API calls causing request timeouts
**Solution**: Implement background processing

```typescript
// Create: app/api/discover/process-recommendations/route.ts
// Move slow external API calls to background
// Use database as queue system
// Return cached results immediately
```

### 2. HIGH: Real Series Detection (15 minutes)  
**Problem**: Series recommendations using mock data
**Solution**: Test against real library

```typescript
// Test: curl "localhost:3001/api/discover/recommendations?type=series&mock=false"
// Should find incomplete series in your 296+ books
// Debug and fix any issues with series logic
```

### 3. HIGH: Author Website Data (20 minutes)
**Problem**: No real author websites for release monitoring  
**Solution**: Add URLs for your favorite authors

```sql
-- Update favorite authors with website URLs
UPDATE authors SET websiteUrl = 'https://stephenking.com' WHERE name = 'Stephen King';
UPDATE authors SET websiteUrl = 'https://brandonsanderson.com' WHERE name = 'Brandon Sanderson';
-- Add RSS feeds where available
UPDATE authors SET rssUrl = 'https://brandonsanderson.com/feed/' WHERE name = 'Brandon Sanderson';
```

### Key Database Queries
```sql
-- Check favorite authors
SELECT * FROM favorite_authors fa JOIN authors a ON fa.authorId = a.id;

-- Check series books  
SELECT series, COUNT(*) as books, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN isCompleted = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed
FROM books 
WHERE series IS NOT NULL AND series != '' 
GROUP BY series;

-- Check recommendations
SELECT * FROM book_recommendations ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## üí° Unique Value Propositions

Your Discover system will be the **only personal audiobook app** that:
1. **Learns from YOUR specific library** (not generic data)
2. **Monitors author websites directly** (finds releases first)  
3. **Uses local AI** (privacy-focused, no data sharing)
4. **Explains every recommendation** (AI reasoning)
5. **Automatically tracks series progress** (no manual input)
6. **Adapts to reading patterns** (completion rates, preferred lengths)

This creates a truly personalized discovery experience that commercial apps like Audible can't match because they don't have access to your complete reading history and personal preferences.
